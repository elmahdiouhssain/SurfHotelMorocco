Agadir has the third-biggest market in North Africa (after Fez and Cairo). The Souk el Had has approximately 6000 shops and is organized in several departments that allows you easily to compare prices and not waste time. You will find various items for local people and a lot of traditionally-produced goods. Discover argan products in all its forms, tasty fresh fruits and vegetables and savor the colorful Moroccan spices. You also find authentic handmade leather bags, various clothes, shoes, furniture and jewelry, and of course souvenirs to bring home to your friends and family. There is nothing you won’t find in a Moroccan market. The market is open six days a week (closed on Mondays). Our tour takes you back via the Kasbah – the oldest fortress in Agadir,  bringing to life the architecture of the previous centuries culture and beauty. The Kasbah is a rare survivor of the 1960 earthquake, all that remains is the outer wall. The Kasbah is situated on a hill that offers a great view over the rest of Agadir.</span></p>
